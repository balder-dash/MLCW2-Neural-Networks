# COMP60012 CW 2 - Artificial Neural Networks

To run the code, in the command line navigate to the folder containing housing.csv, part2_house_value_regression.py, and part_model.pickle

Then enter the following command

```
python3 part2_house_value_regression.py
```

By default it will load the model from part2_model.pickle and score it against the entire dataset in housing.csv, however if you wish to train a single model or run the hyperparameter tuning then the following commands can be run respectively:

```
python3 part2_house_value_regression.py t
python3 part2_house_value_regression.py h
```
